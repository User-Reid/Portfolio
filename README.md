# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<!-- Need to impliment a bio section ideally below digital marketing software developer,
  Need to add contact me section, interest and hobbies, download resume section, link github and repos, feature projects maybe not neccissarily click on the icons?
 -->

<!-- 6-26-24 -->

I stopped after deciding if i wanted to do the Hi I'm ${Reid} thing and then do the const job = [
..., ...,
]

(note: i did go back to the original way, but i may be able to find a middle ground?)

I still need to make the resume button/text look nicer,
need to fix the iframe in desktop mode so there is more space,

fix teeth,
